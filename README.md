## Embler Patterns
A WordPress plugin that adds reusable block patterns.

### === Movie review ===
A short introduction is followed by a multi-column section for the release date, duration, genres, MPAA rating, and buttons to purchase or watch the show. After the general details, you'll write your movie review and use the video placeholder to add a trailer or other related media.

### === Book review ===
A short introduction is followed by a multi-column section for the book cover, description, and buttons to purchase or read the book. After the general details, you'll write your book review and use the placeholder to add a preview from Google Books when available.

### === Music review ===
A short introduction is followed by a multi-column section for the album cover, release date, duration, placeholder for audio, and button to purchase the album. After the general details, you'll write your music single or album review and use the placeholder to add a music video when available.

### === Product review ===
A short introduction is followed by an image of the product and the start of the review. It also includes a multi-column section for a brief description, product name, and a purchase button. A product image serves as the background for the multi-column section.

### === Guest author ===
A square image of the author is left-aligned, with the author's name, bio, and social links on the right.
